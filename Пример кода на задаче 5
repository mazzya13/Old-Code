Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct.
However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. 
Instead, we mask it.
Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.

using System;

namespace CodeWars7
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string a = Kata.Maskify("22");
            Console.WriteLine(a);
        }
    }
    public static class Kata
    {
        // return masked string
        public static string Maskify(string cc)
        {
            int ccLength = cc.Length;
            string cc1 = "";
            if (ccLength <= 4)
            {
                return cc;
            }
            else
            {
                cc = cc.Substring(ccLength - 4);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < ccLength - 4; i++)
            {
                cc1 += "#";
            }
            return cc1 + cc;
        }
    }
}
